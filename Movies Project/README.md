# Udacity-FSWD
## Introduction
###### A static HTML web page which displays the posters of my favorite movies. On clicking the poster, a trailer of the movie will play.
## How to generate the web app
The web app can be generated by running the Entertainment_Center.py file. Here's how it needs to be done.
1. Download all the files and put them on a single folder.         
2. Open the  entertainment center.py and run the file by pressing F5 key.    
3. A new tab on your browser will open with posters of six movies.   
4. A new file fresh_tomatoes.html will be generated. You can click on this file next time when you want to watch my favorite movies.

## Collaborations
Presently, this project is not up for collaboration.
