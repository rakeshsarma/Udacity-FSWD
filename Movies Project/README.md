## Introduction
###### A static HTML web page which displays the posters of my favorite movies. On clicking the poster, a trailer of the movie will play.
## How to generate the web app
The web app can be generated by running the Entertainment_Center.py file. Here's how it needs to be done.
1.Download all the files and put them on a single folder.         
2.Open the  entertainment center.py and run the file by pressing F5 key.
3.A new tab on your browser will open with posters of six movies.
4.A new file fresh_tomatoes.html will be generated. You can click on this file next time when you want to watch my favorite movies.

## Collaborations
Presently, this project is not up for collaboration.
